## TNM085 Modelling Project (Modelleringsprojekt)

### Project
The goal of the project is to create a differential function for a physically correct system using knowledge from the course Modulation and Simulation. The system must in turn be modeled and visualized in a way using the differential equation. A mathematical model for a mechanical watch is studied and simulated using Eulerâ€™s method. The system is
then visualized in OpenGL by using pre-existing 3D models. The report is available [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1S4J_NimdvoEet3-UM_5EwYO7hL-35JH4/view?usp=sharing) (in Swedish).

## TFYA65 Physics of Sound (Ljudfysik)

### Project
The goal of the project is to do a frequency analysis on a given signal, filter according to certain specifications and make 3D animations using the signal. In this case, a low pass and high pass are used to create three audio files in three different frequency ranges. The audio files are then imported into Blender to create an animation to change the objects' properties (such as surface). The report is available [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1vX2lT6q238dQaXUPzaimQc0Zx2j_lgCs/view?usp=sharing) (in Swedish).
