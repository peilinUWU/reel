## [TNCG13] SFX - Tricks of the Trade
###### Boids, Python, Blender

### Project
The goal of the project is to simulate an emergent behavior. This behavior takes place when a number of simple entities interact with each other, resulting in a complex movement which can not be exhibited by an individual. A distributed behavioral model was first proposed by Craig Reynolds, to create an artificial life program named Boids. This model consists of three simple rules: separation, alignment and cohesion. This basic model is sufficient to simulate movements that one often sees from a group of birds, a swarm of insects and a school of fish.

## [TNM108] Machine Learning for Social Media
###### Unsupervised Learning, Supervised Learning, Natural Language Processing, Python

### Project
The goal of the project is to classify animal sounds with the help of Machine Learning. This can be used as a basis to build apps that are suitable for childen and entertainment for example. One possible application could be a person-versus-AI game, where a sound is played and you need to guess which animal it was, and the model tries to classify the animal.

## [TNM095] Artificial Intelligence for Interactive Media
###### Neural Network, Genetic Algorithm, C#, Unity

### Project
The goal of the project is to create an AI that can outperform a human player in a Lunar Lander game. The following goal is to be reached: land the rocket safely at the indicated place in a randomly generated environment. The AI is built on a small neural network, combined with genetic algorithm.

### Project
The goal of the project is to explore the commercial software Terragen. It is a program that generates scenery using procedural methods, and designed to create large scale landscapes, environments and even planets. The report is available [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1XlQe5UKK5CkFcjD74BNM0nKSiiUU6CVI/view?usp=sharing) (in English).

## [TNM069] Graphics Design and Communication
###### Adobe Illustrator, Adobe Photoshop, Adobe InDesign, UX

### Lab
Design a logo using Adobe Illustrator, a cover image using Adobe Photoshop, and a cover layout using Adobe InDesign for *Genre*.

### Project
The goal of the project is to create a visual identity and several marketing materials, including logos and printed materials for a trade show for the business. The final product is a business and employment-oriented social networking service. Audience survey and analysis are conducted. Its functionality allows easy communication and interaction by and between companies and professionals, which is also the main message to be conveyed. The report is available [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1jxz9eQoEwNKrgR70HpnSWzDuL-jxPYCi/view?usp=sharing) (in English). Additionally, you can find the brand book [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/17OUvGHYwN4xUotck3xKaJiR2eYDfcqop/view?usp=sharing), logo [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1B3ajYYmjxbdPivIiXg2naTzHGblfvYPt/view?usp=sharing), and webpage, roll-up and flyer mockup [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1BFDgDph0PYDDFrPijRnMtpt5RnGxPXCE/view?usp=sharing).

## [TNM085] Modelling Project
###### Euler Method, OpenGL

### Project
The goal of the project is to create a differential function for a physically correct system using knowledge from the course Modulation and Simulation. The system must in turn be modeled and visualized in a way using the differential equation. A mathematical model for a mechanical watch is studied and simulated using Eulerâ€™s method. The system is
then visualized in OpenGL by using pre-existing 3D models. The report is available [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1S4J_NimdvoEet3-UM_5EwYO7hL-35JH4/view?usp=sharing) (in Swedish).

## [TFYA65] Physics of Sound
###### MATLAB, Blender

### Project
The goal of the project is to do a frequency analysis on a given signal, filter according to certain specifications and make 3D animations using the signal. In this case, a low pass and high pass are used to create three audio files in three different frequency ranges. The audio files are then imported into Blender to create an animation to change the objects' properties (such as surface). The report is available [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1vX2lT6q238dQaXUPzaimQc0Zx2j_lgCs/view?usp=sharing) (in Swedish).
